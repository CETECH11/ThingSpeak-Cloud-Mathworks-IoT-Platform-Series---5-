ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics service ðŸ“ˆ that allows you to aggregate, visualize, and analyze live data streams in the cloud. It is a MathWorks service specifically for IoT. It provides -

Instant visualizations of data posted by your devices to ThingSpeak.
With the ability to execute MATLAB code in ThingSpeak, we can perform online analysis and process data as it comes in.
Send data from any internet-connected device directly to ThingSpeak using a Rest API or MQTT
Cloud-to-cloud integrations with The Things Network, Senet, the Libelium Meshlium gateway, and Particle.io
Create sophisticated event-based email alerts that trigger based on data coming in from our connected devices.

ThingSpeak is often used for prototyping and proof-of-concept IoT systems that require analytics.Analytics support is derived from MATLAB, and therefore much better insights on the data can be generated in a fast pace environment. ThingSpeak enables sensors, instruments, and websites to send data to the cloud where it is stored in either a private or a public channel. Once data is in a ThingSpeak channel, you can analyze and visualize it, calculate new data, or interact with social media, web services, and other devices

ThingSpeak provides access to MATLAB to make sense of data. We can -

Convert, combine, and calculate new data
Schedule calculations to run at certain times
Visually understand relationships in data using built-in plotting functions
Combine data from multiple channels to build a more sophisticated analysis
Once data is received, it can be used for analysis to calculate something in particular. Let us calculate the Dew Point Temperature with the available data, which requires Temperature and Humidity
